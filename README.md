# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease using patient health data. It leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and model training with XGBoost and Logistic Regression.

## Features

- **Data preprocessing:** Imputation and scaling of features  
- **Categorical handling:** One-hot encoding of categorical variables  
- **Class imbalance:** Addressed using SMOTE oversampling and class weighting  
- **Model training:** XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning and Logistic Regression  
- **Evaluation:** Metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and ROC AUC  
- **Threshold tuning:** Custom threshold selection to improve recall or precision  
- **Visualization:** Precision-Recall curve for informed thresholding  

## Dataset

The dataset contains clinical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and others, along with a target indicating the presence of heart disease.
